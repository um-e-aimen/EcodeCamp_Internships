0,Alex Vando Mens Dress Shirts Regular Fit Long Sleeve Men Shirt,"[{'review_heading': 'Very pleasantly surprised', 'text_review': ""Hey, I don't too much write reviews. But had to do this one. I opened the package and first thing I thought was this shirt looks like it's made out of paper. I hadn't taken it completely out of package yet. Instantly was going to return it. Mulled over it a couple of days, then finally tried it on and WOW. I'm 6 foot 260 pounds with an athletic build I got the 2xl and this shirt fit perfect. It's made of a sateen material with a lil spandex in it so it stretches. Tapers in the body for a nice fitted look. Extremely comfortable and we'll made. I was very pleasantly surprised. Needless to say, I cancelled my return and ordered two more.""}, {'review_heading': 'Great fit and quality!', 'text_review': 'I was skeptical of buying this shirt because I was concerned that, being from China, the shirt likely ran small and was probably going to fit weird, or not fit at all. I liked the price tag and, at least from the pictures,actually kind of liked the shirt (it was for a vegas trip). I followed the sizing chart provided by the seller and measured each dimension (I didn\'t have a fabric tape measure so i just used my phone charging cable, ran the length of cable over or around each measurement and then laid out the length I marked by pinching the cable across a carpenter\'s tape measure - whatever works, right?).\nAfter taking each measurement, I followed the size chart and, somewhat skeptically, ordered the recommended size.\nThe shirt arrived two days later in perfect undamaged condition. Upon unwrapping it, I quickly noticed the quality fabric and craftsmanship. It\'s not spectacular, but it\'s nice. Really nice. Worth every bit of 20 dollars, and then some!\nThe fit was great...I mean, really, really great! The length, the waist, the shoulders, all of it. I was comfortable in it all night and into the next day. I highly recommend this shirt (take your measurements though!).\n\nI\'m 5\'8"" and 230lbs. I\'m broad shouldered and broad chested, and I am a 38"" waist. XL fit great!'}, {'review_heading': 'The shirt benchmark!', 'text_review': ""Button-down shirts are somewhat my addiction. I have a ton with only a few manufacturers. I bought one of these (the purple with polka dots) and loved the way it fit. I'm a slim athletic build and it fit perfectly. Great quality and stunning style. Best part is the eye grabbing attention the shirt got. I got many compliments on it. Highly, highly suggest trying it out.""}, {'review_heading': ""Fit isn't as the pictures suggest."", 'text_review': ""according to the size chart, i should buy medium/large, so i bought two mediums. the stickers on the bags says medium, the tags on the shirt says medium, but the shirts themselves are massive.\n\nmedium should be for 38-40 inch chests, mine is 41, so i expected it to be a little tight around the chest (used to that). the sleeves i expected to be a little long, which they were. not too bad in length, but their circumference makes the shirts very baggy around my forearms.\n\nthe chest on these shirts is clearly closer to 33-34 inches, and they don't taper to the waist nearly as much as the images would suggest. the length from collar to lower seam isn't included in the size chart, but they are way too long.\n\nnow, i wasn't expecting a tailored shirt, handmade for me, but this is a bit ridiculous. slightly loose over chest, way too large over the midsection, and baggy sleeves. fabric and build quality is fine, so i'm sure i can give them away, but quite disappointed. don't buy if you're in shape, because despite the pictures, the shirts sure aren't made for athletic men.""}, {'review_heading': 'Nice shirt for a great price', 'text_review': 'This shirt was very nice, but I did not understand why it had royal blue buttons on it instead of black.

The shirt feels good quality and it fits great. When I shop from Zara/H&M I get medium size but this one I got in small size after looking at their size chart and it's a good fitting. I am 5-10 tall, 157 lb, 31 waist. I like it so much that I ordered 3 more shirts from this seller. The buttons are stitched properly and overall stitch feels solid. This shirt at Zara would easily sell for 40-70 bucks so it's a great great deal.\n\nHeads up, read some reviews that spoke of difficulty with ironing. Luckily I've a steamer and it works great""}, {'review_heading': 'A Little Larger Than I Expected For A Medium...', 'text_review': 'Based on the comments about it being a bit on the ""Slim Fit"" side, I ordered a Medium.

Great for mannequins""}, {'review_heading': 'Ugh, do yourself a favor and stay away from this brand.', 'text_review': ""My impressions from the products shoots is that it looks sharp. It is anything but sharp as soon as I put it on. The material (cotton) is course and feels rough on the skin. Shoulders are tight fitting for a small. This is before first wash.... after wash and low heat drying.... sleeves shrunken by as much as 2 inches!!!\n\nIt's going straight into the trash—I dunno how I can even return this to Amazon for refund. Amazon REALLY needs to review the products their vendors are selling through their site!!!""}, {'review_heading': 'Very Nice & Comfortable Shirt - Attractive', 'text_review': ""I am 5'-10' about 180 and Broad Shouldered. I wear a T-shirt and Back Brace, so I normally buy my shirts to have a little extra room. This is the Second Shirt that I have purchased from Alex Vando. It fits me very nicely, with just enough room for what is underneath, for me. I could probably use a Large Instead if it were not for my Back Brace that needs a T-Shirt under it. An Amazingly Attractive Color and Fantastically Comfortable Shirt. The shirt is almost all cotton. Nice and cool even when it gets sticky out. As I said this was my second Purchase. When you find something you like, Why Search. A Very Good Buy. Very Satisfied. The quality seems to be very good. No loose stitching or threads, buttons were firmly attached. love the plaid reverse collar and cuffs. Distinctive.

It is very thin and even though the tag says it\'s 97% cotton I question the accuracy of this claim. It seems as if the quality of the material is greatly compromised, which makes it feel like thin paper as opposed to quality cotton. As soon as I opened the bag and my wife saw the shirt she said, ""Oh boy, not one of these cheap shirts...""\n\nThe only reason I give it two stars as opposed to one is that the design and colors of the shirt are quality.

I highly recommend this shirt to anyone who has to wear dress shirts for their job or for formal occasions. They’re also SUPER comfortable!

Now i need all these collard shirts. Ive bough a couple diff ones online. Nothing would fit right. Super baggly sleeves just not the look you want. I bought one of these shirts. Packaging was great. No smell. Used plastic clips instead of pins so no hole poked. I got a M the same as i would for any other shirt and its great im so happy. Nice tight sleeves under the arms. Not alot of extra fabric around my core. Id say the collars at 17.5 and sleeves are about a 34. It did come a bit wrinkled but i mean it was in a small bag and shipped across the country.

They Really look nice, as They have a sort of V taper, & That’s The way I’m built, My Chest is almost 50”s & My waist is a 34 & you can’t beat them for the $$. I used to be into Robert Graham, Where My least expensive shirt was in the $200+ range & So ornate, I gave them away in Perfect Condition, as I don’t want or Need That flashy of a shirt nowadays. These shirts are perfect, as they have some decorating when you bend the sleeves back, also going up the button line. They are “Just Enough”. For the price, They Can’t be beat.

I go between large and xlarge depending on the shirt. I have an athletic build so T-shirts I wear xl, dress shirts worn untucked I wear a large. I ordered the black w red trim. Very nice looking shirt. My fiance loves it. The black with red is definitely a bad boy devilish dress shirt.To make others notice you in a mysterious unknown way. To keep them guessing who you are.

Wearing dress shirts with jeans or slacks casualy (untucked) has been a problem with the shirt being much too long. My neck size is 17 inches and arm length is about 36 inches. How ever this shirt is great fitting. I wore it Saturday night out to dinner with wife and family, and got 4 complement.

Oh, I got the XXL.'}, {'review_heading': 'Good shirt for the price', 'text_review': ""I bought this because a recent trip to Italy had me wanting to inject some European style into my wardrobe. I see nothing wrong with the craftsmanship and the shirt looks exactly as it is shown in the pics.\n\nI think the reason they are able to offer the shirt at such a good price is they must have used cheaper fabric. Even when I took the shirt out straight from the dryer it needed to be ironed. I prefer steaming and it took a lot of steam to get the wrinkles out. It really needs an iron. However, even putting it on or sitting down will put obvious creases in it.\n\nI don't consider this a deal killer since I have many other shirts like it, just making other customers aware.""}, {'review_heading': 'Great Fit, Great Quality', 'text_review': 'I bought this shirt for my son to wear for his graduation.

I was attracted to the shirt I saw in a photo and when it arrived, it really is a nice and good looking shirt. It was nicely and neatly folded and packaged like any designer shirt and thus I dropped it at the dry cleaner and had it cleaned to get the folds out, as Id do with any decent new shirt.

I’ll probably order another one at some point.'}, {'review_heading': 'Upscale casual dress shirt', 'text_review': 'I love the shirt design. The different liners in collars and cuff. It gives a dress look with or without jacket. The size is standard US and the sleeve length is perfect for a tall guy. The cut could be an inch fit closer to the body under the arm-pit. You do not have those tents under the arm. I bought the shirt with material with cotton/spandex and it gives a little ease and flex. I bought one first and fell in love with the shirts. I ended up buying 3 for myself and 2 for my son. I prefer nice shirts instead of golf style shirts. My only dissent is the material is thinner than what I normally purchase, but the style and designs got me hooked plus the price.'}, {'review_heading': 'On time, fit great.

Didn't know it was it was stretch but it does indicate spandex on the material section of post.

I just knew this would come in 5 sizes too small so naturally I ordered a size up. I am 6' and 230lbs. The XXL is perfect. It's not right and it doesn't show your stomach when you raise your arms. One fold of the sleeve to show the cuff makes them the perfect length also. I give 5 stars but I am a bit concerned about the button hole size. They are a little smaller than the button so eventually I see the buttons pulling off when I unbutton. Be careful of this and you are the owner of a 5 star shirt.""}, {'review_heading': 'Nice quality shirt and sharp look', 'text_review': ""I have both the grey and black versions of this shirt and love them both. Very sharp for a night out or to the office. The added detail on the button seam and cuffs make a great look to go to work and then nice dinner/night out.

Wear a 42L jacket. Ordered 16-16.5/36-37 in this shirt. There are lots of different opinions about the fit in other reviews, and after wearing the shirt, I can see why. This shirt does not seem like a true ""slim fit."" But it does seem slimmer than a billowy regular fit. It\'s as though this was designed as a tight-fitting shirt for a body builder. Shoulders are broad, armpits are roomy, but it certainly wasn\'t baggy on me. For me, it will work as a dress shirt, but I\'d feel more comfortable wearing it under a slim-fitting sportcoat.

Standard size but with the waist taken in a bit.

That can be a good or bad thing I suppose.\n\nSo to summarize the fit... I\'m an average semi-athletic guy looking for a standard fit shirt with a tapered waist, and I found this shirt unexpectedly small in the shoulders and unexpectedly large in the waist. It honestly just fits like a shirt that\'s a half size down from the collar size. It\'s a little less billowy in the waist than a standard fit shirt but not much, and definitely smaller in the back/shoulders.\n\nOn the other hand, it\'s nice wrinkle-free material and for the price (around twenty bucks) this shirt is a steal and I bought every color they had in my size to wear for work.'}, {'review_heading': 'Slimmer fit, but not slim', 'text_review': ""I've been wearing Kenneth Cole Reaction dress shirts for years.

So I scrolled carefully for reviews stating as such and couldn't find any so I took the chance and bought the shirt. I had a vision of how I wanted the shirt to look and it turned out to be exactly what I wanted and the color looked like the picture in the description. The color is bright, light and fresh without being overly transparent; it's actually a tad transparent but with a light colored shirt like this it's to be expected.

This shirt fits my build very well in that the shoulders fall where they should, with ample room for movement, and there is not an abundance of material around the waist. The sleeve length is good, and there are 2 buttons on each cuff. On the largest button, the the cuff is wide enough to allow for wear of a watch. I wear an Omega Speedmaster that has a high profile, and the cuff fits comfortably over the watch. The collar stays are permanent on this shirt, and there is no pocket for collar stays. I like to use the metal stays w/ magnets to keep my collars in place, especially when wearing with a suit jacket or sports coat, but the collar is stiff and looks neat. The fabric is lightweight, resists wrinkles, and is very easy to iron. I generally wear Brooks Brothers 1818 and 346 shirts, and I would say this Kenneth Cole shirt is comparable to a Brooks Brothers 346 shirt in a Regent fit, but at a 1/3 the price.

This shirts has the collar stays permanently sewn into the collar - the only issue with this, is after running it through the dryer a few times, it will begin to warp the plastic and then you get a curled collar that cannot be undone. I should mention this shirt is not worth taking to be dry cleaned. The worst part about it, is in this day and age there is no reason a dress shirt should be made without being wrinkle resistant.

That is the shirt fresh out of a still tumbling, hot dryer, immediately put on a hanger. There\'s also threads coming loose all over the place (again: pictures.).

This one was close but as with most 2XL shirts they seem to increase the ""width/girth"" of the shirt but not the length. They also tend to have a bottom button that is placed annoying ""high"" leaving the tent flaps wide open on the bottom, this shirt is no exception. I\'ve tried 3XL shirts but I could fit 2 of me in those things! Being overweight as I am the real solution is to put down the donuts and drop down to a healthy size, until then I need a shirt that can ""cover"" me. This shirt was close as I said (regardless of the cardboard/burlap collar) but after washing it on the gentle cycle with cold water, dried on low heat and ironed it shrunk down to a ""snug/uncomfortable"" size. It will do for now, but would it kill Van Heusen, and other shirt makers, to add another button closer to the bottom and give this shirt another inch or two in length for us ""generously"" proportioned fellows?

I don\'t dress to impress, I just want a basic fuss-free shirt, and this one is perfect, especially if you don\'t want to wear white every day.\n\nThe fabric is fairly thin (poplin) and not very soft, so I don\'t wear it directly on the skin, I always wear a cotton crew t-shirt underneath. The fabric does feel better though, than what you would expect from only 35% cotton. The fit is relaxed and comfortable, definitely not tight or fitted - Van Heusen do make a fitted version of this shirt as well. If you are looking for a slim fit - this will probably be a little large. The cut and styling is nothing special but the shirt does not look cheap, it\'s not a piece of clothing that will attract any attention.\n\nMachine washed this many times with no issue, easy to iron as expected from a poplin shirt.\n\nAnother reason to like Van Heusen is that they make a 15.5"" neck with 36""-37"" sleeves - a combination that is not available from many shirt makers - I\'m 6\'3"" and under 200 pounds so I need a fitted shirt with long enough sleeves.\n\nAt under $20 this is great value.

The tailoring and needlework seem OK, but the 'poplin' material is very thin, providing a somewhat translucent look. Definitely doesn't compare to a heavier broadcloth or oxford cloth. And, although it can't be seen clearly in the photo, there is no placket down the button line. A placket is a double layering of fabric that hold the buttons and buttonholes. I think this is important on a dress shirt, since it provides a cleaner look when starched and adds strength. And adds cost, of course. But I guess you get what you pay for.

Just dry it on a cool cycle and shake it and hang it. After an hour on the hanger you can wear the shirt as if it were commercially laundered. The collar and cuffs hold their shape.

I then went back to my room and ordered the slim fit from amazon to arrive the next morning.\n\n1. Someone criticized this for being too thin and see-through -- but that's perfectly normal for a poplin shirt, and you see it in ultra-high end shirts like my Yves St. Laurent poplin shirt (I'm talking $300 per shirt). Poplin is a very thin weave, and it's supposed to look silky smooth (compare to broadcloth, oxford etc. which are thick weaves and which look relatively coarse). It's more for summer wear, and works particularly well if you have to wear your suit all day. And yes always wear these with an undershirt (but then again if you're going casual in the summer, no tie and top button open, and you have a good body, then I guess you can just wear it without an undershirt. You see male models pulling off that sort of look).\n\nAny way, I can see not liking the shirt. But not liking it because it's too thin and see-through is just off-base. That's what it's supposed to do.\n\n2. But this is not completely perfect. The fit is a little large, so definitely get the fitted (and not normal) and maybe the extra slim if they make that. That being said, I haven't seen what happens to these after 10 washes.\n\n3. The cut is also not super-modern. It's fine though. It's like a normal cut, which you might prefer if you don't want to be too stylish / like a dandy etc.\n\n4.

In fact, I have another Van Heusen shirt that is supposedly a 34/35 and its sleeves are inches longer than the shirt I purchased on here. In addition, if you look at how I loosely measured the sleeves in the pictures, the slack in my measuring tape only adds length to the measurement so the sleeves are, in reality, even shorter than my measurement shows.

I purchased the 17.5"" x 36/27 and was delighted at how well the shirt fit me. Many of the older dress shirts I own are very baggy and needed to be folded over and tucked-in in order to create a clean look. The Van Heusen Fitted Poplin dress shirt fits comfortably around my arms and torso and does not restrict any of my movements while wearing.\n\nAfter receiving my shirt, the package indicated that it\'s a ""slim fit"" shirt versus a ""fitted"" shirt as described in the product title. The slim fit shirts are the most fitted type of shirt offered by Van Heusen. I\'m attaching a helpful chart that describes each of the different types of fits. I\'ve also seen similar charts from Van Heusen that respectively describe the sizes as regular fit, athletic fit, and slim fit.\n\nMany reviews indicated that the white dress shirts are thin. I checked out the shirt in a department store before buying. I placed my fingers behind the fabric of this shirt in addition to other brands and found that the thickness/transparency is about average. Due to the nature of white shirts, I do believe that they are best worn with an undershirt underneath. This shirt is no exception.\n\nThe price of this shirt is very affordable and provides great value compared to other brands. The only con, as other reviewers have noted, is that the collar stays are permanently sewn into the garment. The collar stays are plastic so they won\'t rust. In summary, great value and comfortable to wear.'}, {'review_heading': 'Paper thin, do not buy in white', 'text_review': 'I regret buying this. It is paper thin and shows more skin tone through than any other dress shirt I own. Serious flaw. Might be ok in a dark color, looks cheap and bad in white.\n\nOn the positive side, the fit is perfect and true to size. It says it is ""fitted"" but really it is sized for an average non-fat build. Not overly long or billowed out.\n\nThe collar is also on the small size. Is plain white fabric so expensive they had to make it super thin and with an undersized collar?\n\nIt is a shame Amazon doesn\'t have a basic white dress shirt at a low generic price. While not expensive, you can do a lot better just getting a fancy brand on sale at a department store.'}, {'review_heading': 'Irregular sizing', 'text_review': 'I own other Van Heusen fitted shirts that I purchased in store which are softer and provide more room in the shoulders. I originally purchased this shirt in a 16 1/2 however, I had to return it as it was slightly too tight. I then ordered a 17 thinking it would be a better fit. The size 17 does not provide much more room than the 16 1/2 did. The shoulders are tight, the chest is slightly larger, the length is longer, the waist is a little larger than I would like. The shirt is supposed to taper as it goes down however, it seems to get wider. I go to the gym and have a large chest with a slimmer waist. I own a size 16 Van Heusen fitted shirt that fits me better then the 16 1/2 I ordered on Amazon. I own a size 17 that I purchased in store and it provides significantly more room than the 17 ordered from Amazon. In my opinion, the shirts sold on amazon are irregular. Perhaps they were made for another region. The material does not feel the same as my other Van Heusen shirts so I question if they are knock-offs. The amazon shirts are more stiff and less comfortable. I am unhappy with this purchase. I believe that if I did not have a muscular build the shirt would fit fine.

They even have a tag that says ""wrinkle free"" on the shirt. The shirt came wrinkled.\n\n3- The shirt is see through. It\'s so bad that even if you wear a male tang top underneath you can see that too.\n\n4- There are stickers everywhere.

The shirt is ""wash and wear"" 65% polyester and 35% cotton. Don\'t pretend that you didn\'t know what you were getting. Polyester is not as soft or breathable as 100% cotton but this shirt won\'t shrink either. This is important if you plan on buttoning the top button and wearing a tie. Fitted means tapered towards the waist.\n\nI bought the Persian Blue color which is a really nice dark navy blue. Sometimes, you need a break from black. The color is dark so the shirt is not see through.\n\nTo minimize wrinkles, for those that are not familiar with doing laundry:\n\nTake the shirt after washing it and grab the shirt by the collar. Give it a few hard shakes / thrusts as if you were shaking the sand off a beach towel. Then throw the shirt in the dryer.\n\nIf you want a durable low cost but professional looking shirt this is it. Prices can fluctuate wildly. If the shirt costs more than $20, you can probably get the Van Heusen stretch flex collar dress shirt with spandex instead.\n\nUpdate 12/5/20:\nI bought a light purple shirt for < $12.

Anyway, the shirt is very comfortable and the collar size just right. I have a little room in the collar and that helps. The body of the shirt is just right and the shoulder seam comes a little below the end of the shoulder. My wife approves. The material is comfortable and soft. It came out of the dryer wrinkle free.

I\'m 5\'9"", 175 lbs. My chest is 42"" and this shirt fits very well. It might be too tight if I have a slightly thicker chest. Arms should have enough room for up to 16-17"" arm.\nMind you this is a ""Fitted"" shirt, so the shape is slimmer in the mid section and larger in chest. I never bought any Fitted shirt before, so it was a gamble. I was glad it turned out to be a good bet.\n\nSecondly is the material. The fabric is decent and feels a bit rough to the skin. It doesn\'t have that expensive look but good enough for going to work. The wrinkle-free fabric is mixed of 65% polyester and 35% cotton.

You cant tell unless you hold it up with a actual black shirt or if you are matching black pants, it can be a issue in day time. Also it is 100% cotton, fit is a bit snug on chest , BUT it may get worse with washing.\nI also purchased a 2nd Amazon shirt which fit great and the fabric was not see through, and it was more a casual threading as it has a micro wrinkle look vs a candle wax like dress shirt look. This is a great shirt also, yet suffers the dye ink of the indigo black, and not a true black.\nStill I am keeping these and returning the VanHusen.

So that\'s what we ordered -- the first time. Definitely too short. We compared his other dress shirts to be sure it wasn\'t us, and they all were 32/33 (i.e. Men\'s Wearhouse, etc.). So we sent back these two shirts with free return, ordered another gray and brown, both with sleeve length 34/35. And they\'re perfect. SO JUST BEWARE of sleeve length.

I just used some fabric type medical tape on the inside. Hopefully the tie will cover it for the most part. I will be requesting a replacement.

I trimmed back the excess material rather than go through the bother of returning it. I see very few people other than my co-workers and they don't do a visual inspection of my sleeves as often as they probably should.

The top button is very difficult and it’s a snug fit. There’s not much flex. The fabric is thin and in the white version it’s semi-transparent (skin visible through the shirt). The light green version doesn’t have this problem. Recommend ordering standard neck size in a color. Otherwise the shirt appears to be well made and is a good value for the price.\n\nUpdated 10/1/18: The shirt is advertised to be wrinkle free.

The collar really doesn\'t flex that much, is actually quite scratchy, and holds onto sweat like no other. By the end of the day, my neck felt quite uncomfortable since it was now sweaty and a bit raw. The rest of the shirt was actually of ok material, like many of the previous Van Heusen shirts I have worn in the past. It is light and very breathable, however, this regular fit is really baggy. The arms are huge and the sides of the shirt seem to be able to fit another person. I am a big guy (6\'0"" 300 pounds) and even then, the 18.5, 36/37 shirts were big on me. I really had to tuck the back of the shirt together just to keep the front of my shirt from looking like a total mess. Luckily I use shirt stays to hold the shirt down, or else it would balloon like no other.\n\nI am slightly disappointed with this shirt, especially considering the fit and quality of my previous Van Heusen shirts.\n\nThat said, I cannot really complain about the price.

I originally bought CK Slim Fits and thought ""how is this slim?"" I sort of wrote it off and figured that I wouldn\'t find any other brand name dress shirt that would fit any better so I stuck with them.\n\nI went to get one of my CK ""Slims"" tailored one day and it would have cost me $40 to get the shirt both resewn AND darted (because that\'s how much alteration it needed to be ""slim""). I\'m an average size guy (5\'9"" ~160) so this to me was appalling. It seemed like it was time to look for another shirt and that\'s when I found these off-brand, cheap, and amazingly well-fitted, casual dress shirts from FLYHAWK.\n\nThese are seriously the most well-fitting slim-fit dress shirts I\'ve ever tried. There\'s enough breathing room around your midsection, chest, and arms for these to be comfortable but there\'s no extra baggage. The material is also pretty elastic so you can easily bend, stretch, or reach for things without feeling like you\'re in an office-themed strait jacket.\n\nI will say, however, that these are absolutely a CASUAL dress shirt. If you need a casual-looking dress shirt for work or something else then these are great. If you need something more professional then I would continue looking elsewhere. I wish that the shirts were actually a bit dressier, even if that was reflected in the price, because that\'s what I\'m really looking for.\n\nThe main giveaways on it\'s ""cheapness"" are:\n\n- Cheap-looking, basic black buttons. The buttons look like they could\'ve come out of a child\'s sewing or bracelet kit they are that basic. They are bulbous/rounded when a normal dress shirt has flat (and usually neutral-colored) buttons.\n- No collar stays. Those little slots in the tips of your collar are normally reserved for collar stays so that your shirt can have a nice ""point"" in them. These do not even have a slot for the collar stays so there is no option.\n- Cheap-looking sewing. The sewing seams are pushed away from the edges (I assume it\'s easier to make it that way) so the shirt doesn\'t look as nice.\n\nI\'ve included pictures showing the differences between one of these FLYHAWK shirts and a CK ""Slim Fit.""

LOL.\n\nAlso, after buying at least a gazillion and one products on Amazon, this is the very first time I have ever had to endure the ecstasies of returning my previously eagerly anticipated goods. Which makes me slightly PO\'ed. You see, I was extra careful and diligent in my selection of size but despite my best and most thoughtful efforts, I crapped out. The shirts fit way, way too sexily and the sleeves were easily an inch too short. All this, though I selected a slightly bigger collar size than I typically wear. In other words, the sizing chart is mere pulp fiction, completely inaccurate and misleading in my case. This makes me wonder: are the measurements based on garment dimensions (which I measured, btw) or body measurements, or numerology ? Who can among us can know?\n\nLook, your mileage may vary but a word to the wise: go BIG, my friend.\n\nIn conclusion, I AM disppointed with my experience but I can\'t review these shirts too harshly.\n\nThough they have NO labeling and no indication of the mystery fabric used, they seem sturdy enough, cut from a stylish pattern and come in fascinating colors.

The fit around the chest and shoulders was pretty good, but the mid section would be best measured in whatever units are used to describe ocean depth (fathoms?) because holy cow....it's absurd. You could camp under it. You could use it as a wing suit. You could use it in battle to surrender with the confidence that your flag could be seen from space. You could have it tailored and end up with enough spare fabric to clothe Zimbabwe.\n\nI'm quite sure that this shirt is either a joke because no one could actually be this size, or was designed for conjoined twins who are sharing one normal upper body and two of everything from the chest down (giggity), or possibly doubles as a birthing blanket when the Alien finally bursts forth from your belly button after feasting on your internal organs.

This shirt in particular looks amazing. And the shirt goes all the way down to my knees. I’m constantly bending at work and the reaction shirts always get untucked. No longer a problem. These things stay down all day and I’ve never had a problem.\n\nThis is actually the second shirt I’ve ordered, I purchased the blue first because I’ve never had a blue dress shirt before. And I was so impressed I had to start buying more as soon as I got the shirt on.\n\nLike others have mentioned, these are cheaper shirts. But they’re by no means badly made. The material still feels nice and the colors are beautiful. The only issue I’ve had with these shirts so far is having to cut the excess string on the buttons.

The fabric feels like a fine-grain broadcloth, meaning that it's a little scratchy but not enough to be annoying. I expect it won't feel at all scratchy after a few washes. The fabric is thin, which means that wearing this white shirt without an undershirt is iffy if you have chest hair. I do, and I don't have any undershirts because I hate wearing them, so I may not wear this shirt unless I'm going somewhere dark or I am certain to be wearing a vest, jacket, or sweater over it. Aside from being thin, the fabric and the workmanship appear to be of good quality, meaning that the shirt looks good and should last awhile. Bottom line: If it wasn't for the see-through thinness of the fabric -- and the lack of a pocket, which I neglected to mention above -- I'd give this a 5-star review.

If anything, it might be a little overly generous, but tucked in my wife didn\'t spot the extra material. I like the fit.\n\nThe material of the shirt itself is a very nice cotton.

0,Van Heusen Men's Dress Shirt Regular Fit Pinpoint Stripe,"[{'review_heading': 'Good traditional shirt with a few minor issues', 'text_review': ""It's a pretty good, inexpensive casual or business casual shirt. Basic with few extras but pretty good.\n\nIt fits as expected and is comfortable but there are some minor finish issues and it lacks what other shirts in this range have.\n\nFor example, it has no side pleats in back and doesn't have a box pleat below the yoke. It also doesn't have a hanging loop but I don't care about that. If you do you'll be disappointed. So the back is a plain back which is not a problem for me but for some, who wear this to work and want a more finished look it may be an issue. If you're wearing it under a coat no problem of course but you'll have to take it off sometime :-D\n\nThe right cuff buttons are just a tad off so the cuff hem doesn't match exactly. This is only noticeable to me and only because I seem to have a habit of messing with them. So it isn't visible but can be felt.\n\nAlso, there are lots of loose threads from production that aren't removed so be ready to give the shirt a quick going over when you get it. Most of them were simply loose pieces and pulled right out, but a couple of the buttons had to have the threads trimmed. Not a big deal.\n\nI'd give it 5 stars but for the few little issues I mention. Overall a solid shirt (pardon the pun) and a great standby for any traditional guy's closet.""}, {'review_heading': 'Top Shelf Quality, Striped Oxford Long Sleeve Shirts', 'text_review': ""This is one of Van Heusen's better quality made shirts.

I iron everything I wear. These are very well made shirts. Not thin or see through. But not hot and heavy either. They look great with a sport coat and jeans, or as a dress shirt. For the price $22.00, you simply can't beat these shirts. The colors are vivid. It's hard finding Striped Oxford shirts without paying at least $50.00 a pop or more. These are well worth every cent.
